2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0 input g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0 input g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0__0 input g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0__0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#4 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0__0 input g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0__0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0 output g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0__0 output g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0 multiplier stage g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0__0 multiplier stage g_MOORE.u_sm/accumulator0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-142#1 Warning
SLICE_PairEqSame_B6B5_WARN  
Luts B6LUT and B5LUT in use in site SLICE_X12Y89 with different equations without A6 pin connected to Global Logic High.
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
No routable loads  
5 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are g_MOORE.u_sm/op_store[4:0].
Related violations: <none>
